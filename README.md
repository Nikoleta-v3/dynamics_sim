# DyPy: A python library for simulating matrix-form games.
## dynamics_sim
A generic evolutionary game theory simulation library.

This is based off of Eric Lubin's wonderful DyPy library. Andrew Ferdowsian updated it to Python 3.0 with additional functionality. It is now extended to include frequency biased imitation and group selection.

For instructions on usage please see the Wiki and for installation information see the README file in the dynamics_sim-master folder.
